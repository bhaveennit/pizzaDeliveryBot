# pizzaDeliveryBot
The code was written as part of a competetion where we had got a task to deliver pizza's anywhere in a flex of 2*2.2 m dimensions.The current code can transport the bot from one corner of the flex to the other corner using the mapping and node counting algorithm.Further developement on the code can be made by making the bot artificially intelligent such that given a timeline of pizza's the bot by itself decides where to go first such that it saves time and distance.
Some parts of the code had already been written as part of open source project,the main file "White line following" is the one which has the working alogorithm.
