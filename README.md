# pizzaDeliveryBot
This code is written in AVR Studio 6 for Atmega 2560 microcontroller on the Firebird V robotics research platform.
The code was written as part of a competetion where we had got a task to deliver pizza's anywhere in a flex of 2*2.2 m dimensions.The current code can transport the bot from one corner of the flex to the other corner using the mapping and node counting algorithm.Further developement on the code can be made by making the bot artificially intelligent such that given a timeline of pizza's the bot by itself decides where to go first such that it saves time and distance.Also we designed a two axis arm to pick and place the pizza's a new three axis arm may be designed for a wider range of motions.
The main file "Main.c" is the one which has the working alogorithm.
